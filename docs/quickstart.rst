**HOW TO GET HY REAL FAST**:

1. Create a `Virtual Python Environment
   <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv>`_.
2. Activate your Virtual Python Environment.
3. Install `hy from GitHub <https://github.com/hylang/hy>`_ with ``$ pip install git+https://github.com/hylang/hy.git``.
4. Start a REPL with ``hy``.
5. Type stuff in the REPL::

       => (print "Hy!")
       Hy!
       => (defn salutationsnm [name] (print (+ "Hy " name "!")))
       => (salutationsnm "YourName")
       Hy YourName!

       etc

6. Hit CTRL-D when you're done.
7. If you're familiar with Python, start the REPL using ``hy --spy`` to check what happens inside::

       => (+ "Hyllo " "World" "!")
       'Hyllo ' + 'World' + '!'

       'Hyllo World!'

*OMG! That's amazing! I want to write a Hy program.*

8. Open up an elite programming editor and type::

       #! /usr/bin/env hy
       (print "I was going to code in Python syntax, but then I got Hy.")

9. Save as ``awesome.hy``.
10. Make it executable::

        chmod +x awesome.hy

11. And run your first Hy program::

        ./awesome.hy

12. Take a deep breath so as to not hyperventilate.
13. Smile villainously and sneak off to your hydeaway and do
    unspeakable things.
